//! The post-index relationship graph stage.
//!
//! Runs only after a source's base index is published, against that exact
//! published build, and never changes a base row:
//!
//! 1. [`plan_graph`] compares the recorded [`GraphState`] with the active
//!    base and yields a [`RelationshipPlan`] with a stable reason code:
//!    `skip` when the graph is `ready` for the active base generation and
//!    derivation; `rebind` when the base was republished with semantically
//!    identical inputs (same [`graph_input_digest`](ragmonk_storage::graph::graph_input_digest),
//!    no parsing or resolution); `full` when the graph's rows or dependency
//!    metadata cannot be reused; otherwise `incremental` (or `retry` after a
//!    failure) over the files whose semantic key (kind, status, content
//!    hash; never write times) changed.
//! 2. Each code file to derive is re-read from the source root and its
//!    sha256 compared with the published `content_hash`. A mismatch means
//!    the file changed after indexing: the graph is marked `stale` and
//!    nothing is published (never a graph of mixed snapshots); the next
//!    index pass picks the change up and the graph is retried against it.
//! 3. In one SQLite transaction: verify the base generation is still the
//!    one planned against, replace the changed files' relationships,
//!    re-resolve cross-file references, relink, re-apply manual link intent
//!    and promote the new graph generation. Re-resolution is scoped by the
//!    per-file symbol dependencies ([`FileSymbols`](ragmonk_storage::graph::FileSymbols)): the changed files,
//!    plus every unchanged file with a reference whose qualified or bare
//!    name matches a definition the changed or removed files had before or
//!    have now (added, removed, moved or newly ambiguous targets).
//!    Candidates are looked up per symbol, never by loading the build, and
//!    only rows whose outcome changed are rewritten. Any error
//!    rolls everything back and records `failed`; the base index stays
//!    published and searchable throughout.
//!
//! Work and memory are bounded: files are parsed `workers` at a time in
//! batches of [`GRAPH_BATCH`], each batch written before the next is read.
