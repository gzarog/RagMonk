//! RagMonk server backends (OpenSearch and Elasticsearch).
//!
//! * [`schema`]: the index set `{prefix}-{source-state,files,code,
//!   documents,chunks,relationships,runtime}` with strict mappings,
//!   vector/HNSW settings fixed at creation and a `_meta.schema_version`.
//! * [`status`]: batched, bounded status reads and fenced run heartbeats.
//! * [`backend::ServerBackend`]: idempotent writes with deterministic
//!   IDs, bounded adaptive bulk batching, and atomic per-source build
//!   publication (an unpublished build is never returned by any read).
//!
//! OpenSearch and Elasticsearch share one adapter; [`engine::Engine`]
//! isolates the few mapping/query differences (vector field types).
