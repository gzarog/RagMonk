//! AI providers for `ragmonk ask` (RUST-14): the reference's `ai/`
//! package. A provider only consumes the evidence `explore` already
//! assembled; nothing here reads a database or ranks anything.
//!
//! * [`prompt`]: the shared evidence prompt and request/answer shapes.
//! * [`http`]: OpenAI, OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic and Ollama over HTTP.
//! * [`factory`]: provider selection with the `privacy.external_ai_allowed`
//!   gate applied before anything is constructed.
//! * [`registry`]: the provider capability table.
//! * [`transport`], [`codex`], [`copilot`]: the subscription runtimes.
