# CI

Three workflows, all in `.github/workflows/`:

| Workflow | File | Triggers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CI` | `rust.yml` | every pull request; pushes to `main` and `release/ragmonk-1.0-clean-slate` |
| `Nightly` | `rust-nightly.yml` | daily 03:00 UTC; manual dispatch |
| `Rust release` | `rust-release.yml` | unchanged: green push CI on `main` (`workflow_run`), tags, manual |

The workflow name `CI` and its push triggers are what `rust-release.yml`
listens to; do not rename them. A failed `CI` push run never releases.

## What runs when

| Job | Application PR | Installer PR | Docker PR | Docs-only PR | Push (main / release branch) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Detect changes | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (selects everything) |
| Repository audits | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Rust fmt/clippy/test (ubuntu-latest) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ + `cargo build --release` |
| Rust fmt/clippy/test (windows/macos) | – | – | – | – | ✓ incl. `cargo build --release` |
| Server integration (OpenSearch + Elasticsearch) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Install script (ubuntu, macos, windows) | – | ✓ | – | – | ✓ |
| Container image (linux/amd64) | – | – | ✓ | – | ✓ |
| CI gate | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 150-source status benchmark | – | – | – | – | – (nightly) |

The Linux Rust job always requires the pinned OCR, embedding and reranker
models (`RAGMONK_REQUIRE_OCR=1`, `RAGMONK_REQUIRE_MODELS=1`).
`.github/actions/fetch-models` checks every model file's sha256 after a
cache restore, so a cache hit alone is never trusted.

### Path classification

`scripts/ci_changes.sh` reads the PR's changed paths (the merge commit
against its first parent) and decides:

- **installer**: `install.sh`, `install.ps1`, `crates/ragmonk-update/**`, `xtask/**`
- **docker**: `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, `docker/**`, `scripts/fetch_models.sh`
- **both**: `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, any crate
  manifest, `.github/workflows/**`, `.github/actions/**`, the classifier itself

`scripts/ci_changes.sh --self-test` checks representative paths and runs
first in the job. Any error (diff, classifier, self-test) fails
`Detect changes`, and the CI gate fails with it. A broken filter cannot
skip a job and still go green.

## CI gate

`CI gate` always runs (`if: always()`) and reads every job's result:

- `Detect changes`, audits, Linux Rust and server integration must succeed.
- On pushes, every job must succeed.
- On PRs, the Windows/macOS job may be skipped. Installer and Docker jobs
  may be skipped only when `Detect changes` succeeded and did not select
  them. A selected job that fails, is cancelled or is missing fails the gate.

The gate has no permissions and sees no secrets.

## Concurrency

`ci-${PR number || run id}`, with `cancel-in-progress` only for
`pull_request`. A new push to a PR cancels its previous run. Pushes get a
unique group, so a `main` run is never cancelled.

## Nightly

`rust-nightly.yml` starts OpenSearch 2.15.0 and Elasticsearch 8.15.0 and
runs the ignored release-mode `ragmonk-status --test live_server`
benchmark unchanged. Its log and duration are uploaded as the
`status-benchmark-log` artifact (14-day retention). It never publishes.

## Required checks (repository settings)

Branch protection is set in GitHub settings, not in this repository.
Rollout order:

1. Merge this change while the old required checks are still set. The
   `Rust fmt/clippy/test (ubuntu-latest)` and `Server integration` names
   are unchanged.
2. Once `CI gate` has reported on a run, make it the required check and
   remove `Rust fmt/clippy/test (windows-latest)`,
   `Rust fmt/clippy/test (macos-latest)` and the `Install script (*)` /
   `Container image` names. PRs no longer always report those, and a
   required check that never reports blocks merging.

## Baseline (2026-10-08, before this change)

- PR run: 1038 s wall, https://github.com/gzarog/RagMonk/actions/runs/37847236804
  (Windows 1034 s, macOS 896 s, Docker 492 s, Linux 477 s, server 230 s).
- Main run: 1946 s wall, https://github.com/gzarog/RagMonk/actions/runs/37797728388;
  the automatic release that followed took 1374 s.

Wall time is measured from the run's start to its last job's end. The
targets are ≤ 600 s warm and ≤ 1200 s cold for PRs. After this change,
record P50/P90 wall time and runner minutes from at least five PR runs and
two main runs here. The targets are estimates until those runs exist.

## Rollback

Revert the change: `rust.yml` returns to the all-OS matrix with the
benchmark inline. Delete `rust-nightly.yml`, `.github/actions/fetch-models`
and `scripts/ci_changes.sh`, then restore the previous required check names.
