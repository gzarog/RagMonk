# ADR 0015: Cross-encoder reranker and embedding-model baseline (RUST-09, slice 3)

Status: accepted

## Decisions (user)

1. **Reranker.** Port the reference cross-encoder,
   `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`, to pure Rust (Candle), with
   score parity against Python.
2. **Embedding model.** Keep `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` and
   record its measured search quality as the V2 baseline. No model change.

## Reranker (`ragmonk_ml::reranker`)

- **Pinned assets.** The model is pinned in the manifest by revision
  `233902d2` plus sha256 of `config.json`, `model.safetensors` and
  `tokenizer.json`. Every file is verified on load, like the embedder.
- **Shared encoder.** It reuses the slice-1 BERT encoder, which gains
  `forward_typed`. Sentence pairs need segment ids: 0 for the query, 1 for
  the passage.
- **Scoring.** The pooler (dense + tanh on `[CLS]`) feeds a one-logit
  classifier. As in the reference, the raw logit is the score, with no
  activation applied.
- **Preprocessing** matches the reference:
  - each passage is capped at 4,000 characters;
  - the pair is truncated longest-first at 256 tokens;
  - batches hold 16 pairs.
  
  Unlike the reference, batches are formed in order of length. Padding is
  masked, so scores do not change; a test asserts this.
- **`rerank()`** ports `rerank_hits`:
  - it reorders only the first `top_n` items, sorting stably by descending
    score, and leaves the remainder in its original order;
  - with `top_n = 0` or fewer than two items, it returns the input
    unchanged;
  - if scoring fails (no model, or a score-count mismatch), it logs at
    info level and returns the input unchanged. An optional rerank never
    fails a search.
- **Hit metadata now matches the reference's vector metadata**, because the
  reranker scores the snippet (else the title):
  - a chunk's title is the document title, else its path;
  - the snippet is the first 280 characters of the text, with a table's
    cells joined by spaces;
  - the heading path moves to `section`.
- **Hybrid search wiring is RUST-10.** That means lexical + semantic → RRF
  → exact-match pinning → rerank, plus the config switch. This slice
  delivers and verifies the stage itself.

## Evidence

- **Logits.** `compat/golden/reranker-ms-marco.json` comes from the
  reference (`compat/tools/gen_reranker_golden.py`): 8 queries × 20
  passages, including over-length, Greek, Japanese and emoji text.
  - Rust's worst logit difference is **4.5e-4**; the assertion allows 2e-3.
  - The reranked orders are identical, apart from swaps between near-ties
    under 4e-3.
- **Quality baseline.** The reference's 72 golden queries over its
  search-quality fixture project are copied to
  `compat/fixtures/search_quality` by `compat/tools/gen_quality_golden.py`.
  Two arms are scored: semantic top 10, and the top 20 reranked by the
  cross-encoder, then top 10. Rust's numbers are **identical** to the
  reference on all 12 metrics:

| | Recall@1 | Recall@3 | Recall@5 | Recall@10 | MRR | NDCG@10 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| semantic | 0.706 | 0.822 | 0.863 | 0.917 | 0.858 | 0.838 |
| semantic + rerank | 0.678 | 0.891 | 0.919 | 0.924 | 0.855 | 0.859 |

  The reranker lifts Recall@3–10 and NDCG@10 but costs a little Recall@1.
  The reference's own hybrid evaluation (`benchmarks/search_quality/
  reranker_evaluation.json`) shows the same pattern. The test fails if any
  metric drifts by more than 0.03 from the reference record.

## Benchmark

Same machine (4 threads). Each call scores 20 pairs, the 8 fixture queries
against all 20 test passages, which include texts of 3,000–5,000
characters:

| | Python (torch) | Rust (Candle) |
|---|---|---|
| p50 per call | 503 ms | 758 ms |
| Model load | — | 0.76 s |

- Rust is about 1.5× slower, the same CPU gap slice 1 measured for
  embeddings. Batching in length order brought Rust from 2.3 s to 0.76 s.
- On the realistic workload, the top 20 snippets of 280 characters or
  fewer, the rerank stage takes 246 ms p50 (303 ms p95) in Rust.

## Limitations

- Inference is CPU-only at f32.
- The stage is not yet called from search; RUST-10 does that.
- The quality fixture is small (6 files, 72 queries). It is a regression
  baseline, not a model-selection study. Revisit the model only with a
  larger labelled corpus.
