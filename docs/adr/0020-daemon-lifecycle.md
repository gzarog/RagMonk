# ADR 0020: Daemon lifecycle, PID ownership and reconciliation

Status: accepted

## Context

The daemon runs indexing passes on one worker thread. A second thread
re-checks every source on a timer. A separate CLI process finds the daemon
through `daemon.pid` and reports on it from `daemon_health.json`. The
watchers and targeted passes are ADR 0021.

## Decisions

### Worker and scheduling (`ragmonk_indexing::daemon`)

- **Threads.** One worker thread runs passes from a FIFO queue. A
  reconciliation thread enqueues every enabled source every
  `indexing.reconciliation_interval_seconds` (default 900). One mutex and
  one condvar guard the queue. Every wait wakes at once on stop.
- **Coalescing (`daemon::scheduler::Scheduler`).** A state machine with no
  threads, so it can be replayed deterministically in tests:
  - Each source has no entry, or is `queued`, `running` or
    `running_followup`.
  - A burst of triggers becomes at most one queued pass plus one
    follow-up.
  - Touched paths, force-full, and the first trigger reason of a batch
    accumulate. The pass takes them when it starts.
  - `startup` and `reconciliation` force a full pass. So do more than 200
    touched paths, or none.
- **Fairness across sources.** A follow-up joins the back of the queue,
  so a source that keeps changing never starves the others. The tests
  check this order.
- **Lock contention.** Every pass takes `locks/index.lock` with operation
  `daemon`, waiting up to `indexing.lock_timeout_seconds`. On timeout the
  worker backs off for 5 s (cut short by stop), then re-enqueues the
  source with reason `lock_contention`. The source is still `running` at
  that point, so the re-enqueue becomes its follow-up. The scan request is
  built only after the lock is won, so touched paths survive the
  contention.
- **Database connections.** Two separate connections are used:
  - The worker owns its connection through a `PassRunner`. The production
    runner is `CoordinatorRunner`: its own `ControlPlane`, the full
    registry, and `run_source`.
  - The daemon's own reads (which sources exist, the health snapshot) go
    through a separate `Catalog` connection.
  - Neither connection is shared across threads.
- **Progress.** Each pass runs under `progress::track(operation="daemon",
  source_total=1)`, so `index_progress.json` and the status verdicts from
  ADR 0019 cover daemon passes.
- **Graceful stop.**
  - New triggers are refused, and queued passes are dropped.
  - A pass already running finishes. It commits per file anyway.
  - Both threads are joined, and a final health snapshot is written.

### Files

- **`daemon.pid`.** The file is `{"pid", "started_at"}`. The reader is
  tolerant: a string pid
  is accepted, a float is truncated, and a non-string `started_at` is
  stringified. Anything else reads as "no daemon".
- **Stale PID files.** A dead PID counts as "not running". Liveness comes
  from `sysinfo`: no `unsafe` code, and a zombie counts as dead.
- **`daemon_health.json`.** Writes are atomic, with a per-process and
  per-thread temp name. A source entry with unknown keys makes the
  snapshot unreadable.

### CLI (`ragmonk daemon …`)

- **`start`.**
  - Spawns `ragmonk daemon run` detached: its own process group on POSIX,
    `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP | CREATE_NO_WINDOW` on Windows.
  - Output goes to `logs/daemon.out.log`.
  - Records the child's PID, then waits up to 30 s for its first health
    snapshot.
  - On failure it removes the PID file and names the log.
  - It deletes any old health file first, so a
    snapshot left by a previous run cannot pass as "healthy".
- **`stop`.** On POSIX it sends SIGTERM, through `sysinfo`. On Windows it
  hard-terminates the process. It waits up to 15 s and removes the PID
  file.
- **`run`.**
  - Runs in the foreground.
  - Refuses to start if another live daemon owns the home.
  - When started by hand, records its own PID, and removes the file on
    exit only if the file still names this process.
  - SIGTERM and SIGINT are caught through `signal-hook` on Unix, which
    triggers a graceful stop.
- **`status [--json]`.**
  - `--json` prints a payload with a fixed key order.
  - The text output is plain text.
- **`restart`.** Runs `stop`, then `start`.
- **Windows caveat.** The spawned daemon inherits the CLI's inheritable
  handles. If the caller pipes `daemon start`'s output, the pipe stays
  open while the daemon runs; Rust's std has no stable way to close
  inherited handles. The process test redirects output to files for this
  reason.

## Tests

- **Expected results.** `fixtures/expected/daemon.json` covers:
  - uptime text, 14 cases;
  - `read_pid_file`, 10 raw files;
  - `read_health`, 7 raw files;
  - 5 trigger scripts replayed on the scheduler, recording the queue, the
    per-source states and each pass's request after every step.

  `tests/daemon_golden.rs` checks them.
- **Behavior tests (`tests/daemon.rs`).** These use a scripted runner and
  cover:
  - bursts coalescing;
  - fairness;
  - forced full passes;
  - lock contention with backoff, retry and touched paths kept;
  - the reconciliation timer;
  - the health snapshot, including offline sources;
  - graceful stop;
  - a real `CoordinatorRunner` pass, publishing progress.
- **Process test (`ragmonk-cli/tests/daemon.rs`).** Runs `start`, then
  `status --json`, a second `start`, `run` while another daemon is
  running, `stop`, and `stop` again.
