# ADR 0003 — Dependency policy

Status: accepted

* Shared versions live in `[workspace.dependencies]`; crates use `.workspace = true`.
* Preferred stack: tokio, clap, serde, thiserror/anyhow, tracing,
  reqwest+rustls, rusqlite, notify, tree-sitter, tokenizers, axum, and
  docling.rs behind RagMonk's own trait.
* A new dependency needs: maintained upstream, permissive license compatible
  with MIT, builds on Windows/Linux/macOS without system packages where
  possible (e.g. `rusqlite` `bundled`), and a reason it beats a few lines of
  local code.
* `anyhow` only at process/application boundaries; libraries use `thiserror`.
* TLS uses rustls; no OpenSSL requirement.
* `Cargo.lock` is committed (the workspace ships binaries).
* Toolchain is pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml` (1.90.0); MSRV is the
  workspace `rust-version` (1.89, needed for `std::fs::File::try_lock`).
* The production runtime has no dependency outside the Rust binary and its
  bundled model assets.
