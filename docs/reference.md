# RagMonk reference

Detail behind the [README](../README.md) pitch deck.

## Document formats

| Format | What you get |
|---|---|
| **PDF** | Layout model: headings, tables, page numbers · OCR for scanned pages (`documents.ocr: auto`) |
| **DOCX / ODT** | Heading structure with page provenance |
| **PPTX / ODP** | Slide titles and body text, slide-number provenance |
| **XLSX / ODS / CSV** | Tables rendered and chunked row-by-row |
| **HTML / Markdown** | Wikis, docs-as-code, ADRs, runbooks |
| **TXT / EPUB** | Plain text and e-books |
| **PNG / JPG / TIFF** | Opt-in OCR (`documents.image_ocr: true`) |
| **EML** | Subject, headers and body · supported attachments indexed as child documents (see below) |

- A corrupt or unsupported file is isolated and recorded as failed; the run continues.
- Older binary `.doc` / `.ppt` / `.xls` files and `.rtf` are detected but not converted.
- PDF conversions are cached by content hash; unchanged PDFs skip the layout model.
- Chunk sizes follow the embedding model's real tokenizer (`documents.chunking.max_tokens: auto`); tables split at row boundaries.

## Email attachments

An `.eml` file's MIME attachments in any supported format above (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, TXT, …) are converted with the same pipeline as standalone files and indexed as **child documents of the email**. The `.eml` stays the only indexed file: no extra file rows, queue jobs or status counts are created for attachments.

- Search results for attachment text keep the real `.eml` path and add `location.attachment` (`name`, `content_type`, `format`, `index`, `parent_title`); the CLI prints `Attachment: <email.eml> -> <name>`.
- Changing or deleting the `.eml` replaces or removes all of its attachment knowledge.
- Unsupported (`.zip`, `.exe`, …), empty, oversized or corrupt attachments are skipped or reported without affecting the email body. Archives are not unpacked and attached emails (`message/rfc822`) are not recursed into.
- Filenames are display metadata only; attachments are written under internal temporary names and removed after conversion.

| Setting | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `documents.email_attachments` | `true` | `false` restores body-only `.eml` indexing. |
| `documents.email_attachment_max_bytes` | `26214400` (25 MiB) | Largest decoded attachment converted. |
| `documents.email_attachment_max_count` | `50` | Attachments processed per email. |
| `documents.email_attachment_total_max_bytes` | `104857600` (100 MiB) | Total decoded attachment bytes per email. |

Toggling `email_attachments` reprocesses `.eml` files (only those) on the next index; previously indexed emails pick up their attachments without being touched.

## Search

```bash
ragmonk search "remote work equipment allowance"   # --table · --json · --limit N · --explain · --hybrid
ragmonk docs [--source <id>]                       # list indexed documents
```

### Evidence, hard filters and grounding

```bash
ragmonk evidence "who calls SettlementService.process" --json
ragmonk evidence "compare billing and ledger retry limits" --source <id> --source <id>
ragmonk search "refund policy" --path docs/ --kind document --no-attachments --explain --json
```

`ragmonk evidence` (MCP: `ragmonk_evidence`) routes the query to a typed intent (`exact_symbol`, `path_lookup`, `code_navigation`, `impact_analysis`, `document_fact`, `conceptual`, `cross_source_comparison`, `multi_hop`, `ambiguous`) without any model or network call, then runs only the strategies that intent needs.

- **Hard filters** (`--source`, `--path`, `--kind`, `--document`, `--no-attachments`, also on `search`) are applied before retrieval and to every stage: lexical, semantic, graph callers, context and every subquery. No stage can widen them.
- **Decomposition**: comparisons, flows and multi-part questions are split into at most `search.decomposition.max_subqueries` (default 4) subqueries; each comparison side keeps its best hit.
- **Duplicates** are removed by provenance and content; at most `search.diversity.per_document_cap` chunks per file. `search.diversity.enabled` (MMR, off by default) is opt-in: on the P0 evaluation it lowered comparison coverage.
- **Citations**: every result is an `[E#]` with source, build, record, path, line/page and a content fingerprint, re-verified against the same snapshot; a deleted file, a stale build or a filtered record is reported `valid: false`.
- **Verdict**: `supported`, `partial` (a part of a multi-part question has no support), or `insufficient_evidence` (nothing reaches `search.grounding.min_coverage` of the query's content terms). `ragmonk ask` abstains without calling the provider on `insufficient_evidence`, gives the model only verified evidence as untrusted data, and reports uncited sentences and unknown citation ids under `grounding.answer_check`.
- The whole run is bounded by `search.max_query_budget_ms` (default 5000); skipped stages are listed under `diagnostics.degraded`.

| Setting | Default |
|---|---|
| `search.routing.enabled` | `true` |
| `search.decomposition.enabled` / `.max_subqueries` / `.llm_enabled` | `true` / `4` / `false` |
| `search.diversity.enabled` / `.lambda` / `.per_document_cap` / `.per_source_cap` | `false` / `0.7` / `3` / `0` |
| `search.grounding.enabled` / `.min_coverage` | `true` / `0.5` |
| `search.max_query_budget_ms` | `5000` |

Optional profiles (set with `ragmonk config set`; none enables an expensive model by default):

| Profile | Settings |
|---|---|
| code-heavy | defaults; `search.semantic false` |
| document-heavy | `search.semantic true`, `search.lazy_semantic true`, `search.grounding.min_coverage 0.6` |
| mixed | `search.semantic true`, `search.reranker.enabled true` (measure latency first: the reranker raised p95 in `benchmarks/semantic-quality.json`) |

Quality is gated in CI by the 72-query golden set and by a 250-query generated evaluation (`crates/ragmonk-service/tests/p0_eval.rs`, held-out floors in `fixtures/p0/eval-gates.json`, last report in `benchmarks/p0-retrieval-eval.json`). Its labels come from the corpus generator, not from independent human labeling.

## Code

<!-- clean-slate-audit: allow-start -->

Full extraction for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript/TSX, Go, Java, Rust and C#; HTTP routes from Python decorators and C# route attributes. Other languages are indexed for full-text search only.

<!-- clean-slate-audit: allow-end -->

```bash
ragmonk symbol | callers | callees | references | impact  <Symbol>
ragmonk link list
ragmonk link add <entity> <document> [--section ID]
ragmonk link remove <ID>
```

## Indexing speed

| Setting | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `documents.pdf_mode` | `accurate` | `fast` reads only the PDF text layer (no layout or table models, no model loading). On a 24-PDF test corpus: 81s to 1.6s. Loses heading/table structure and multi-column reading order; low-text PDFs still follow `documents.ocr`. |

Changing `pdf_mode` reprocesses PDFs on the next index (each mode has its own conversion-cache entries).

Cross-domain linking (code identifiers mentioned in documents) uses a word index plus a pattern cache instead of testing every identifier against every document section: a 2,100-file cold index spent 222s linking before and 0.7s after, with identical links.

## Indexing behaviour

- `ragmonk index` keeps going when one source fails, reports it, and exits non-zero at the end.
- **Two stages per run, with a barrier.** Stage 1 indexes and publishes every selected source (scan, diff, conversion, code entities, chunking, embeddings). Only after **all** of them finished does stage 2 build relationship graphs (code edges, cross-file resolution, code-document links, manual link projection), for the sources that published. Search over a newly published index is available as soon as its stage-1 pass publishes; a graph never holds it back. The daemon applies the same barrier: graph work runs once no index pass is queued or running.
- **`indexing.relationships_enabled: false`** skips stage 2 entirely. Existing graphs are hidden from graph queries (callers, callees, impact, links) but never deleted, and no other indexed knowledge is touched. Toggling the setting never reindexes content: re-enabling it re-validates the retained graph against the published index.
- **Every graph belongs to one exact published index.** A graph records the base build and generation it was derived from; graph queries only return a graph that matches the active base (otherwise they return nothing, and `status` says why: `pending`, `building`, `stale`, `failed` or `disabled`). Graphs are published atomically (local: one SQLite transaction; server: an invisible graph generation promoted by one compare-and-swap fenced by the writer lease and the expected base build), so a failed or interrupted graph build is never visible.
- **Stage 2 never redoes stage 1.** It derives edges from the published files, re-reading each code file and checking it against the published content hash: a file edited after indexing makes the graph `stale` (nothing is published, never a mix of snapshots) until the next index pass. Updates are incremental: only changed files are re-derived, and per-file symbol dependencies (what each file defines and which qualified/bare names its cross-file references look up) limit re-resolution to the changed files plus the unchanged files that reference a symbol whose definitions changed; candidates are looked up per symbol and only changed outcomes are written. Changes are semantic: a file counts as changed only when its kind, status or content hash changed (never its write time), and a reference is re-resolved only when the candidates of a name it looks up changed (a definition added, removed, renamed or reordered; a body-only edit re-resolves no other file). In server mode a new graph generation copies unchanged files' edges and links forward server-side (in place, no duplicate records) and bulk-writes only changed files.
- **Graphs outlive base builds.** Each graph keeps a dependency manifest (semantic file keys, per-file symbols, an input digest that also covers the manual link intent). A source whose graph is current is skipped (in server mode without taking the writer lease); a republished base with identical inputs is *rebound* to the new snapshot without parsing or resolving anything; a full base rebuild carries the graph into the new build and re-derives only what changed. The server stores the manifest with the graph generation, so a host that lost its staging cache (or a new writer host) adopts the published graph instead of deriving it again. A missing, outdated or corrupt manifest falls back to a full graph recomputation of that source (reason-coded, still without reindexing).
- **Cross-source dependencies are explicit.** A consumer source's references that stay unresolved locally are looked up, by exact qualified name only, in the producer sources it depends on: C# `<ProjectReference>` items pointing into another registered source are discovered, anything else is declared in `indexing.relationship_dependencies` (`"<consumer> -> <producer>"`, source ids or paths). Package references are listed as unsupported, never guessed; sources outside a dependency are never consulted, and a name defined in several producers is recorded as ambiguous. Bindings are a separate layer: the consumer's own graph rows are unchanged. A consumer is updated only when a candidate it looks up changed (a producer's implementation-only edit leaves it alone), also when the run indexed only the producer (`--source`); unavailable or disabled consumers and producers are reported `stale`/`pending`, and the next run retries them.
- **Graph failures are reported separately.** A source whose index published but whose graph failed or went stale is a partial success: its index stays published and searchable, the run prints a `relationships ...` line and a `Relationships:` total, and the run exits with the partial-failure code. `ragmonk relationships build [--source ID] [--json]` retries or initializes graphs without reindexing anything.
- **Last Scan** is the last completed filesystem scan; a later failure shows up as **Last Error**.
- An unreachable source is marked **OFFLINE** and its knowledge is never deleted.

## Status and observability

`ragmonk status` answers: is indexing running, progressing, stalled or failing, where, and what failed. It is built by one crate (`ragmonk-status`, ADR 0034); the CLI, the MCP `ragmonk_status` tool and the Admin UI (`/`, `/api/status`, `/ready`) all show the same report.

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| *(none)* | Backend and health, totals, every active pass, one row per source (past 25 sources, completed ones fold into one line), problems, newest errors |
| `--watch [--interval 2]` | Redraws in place; throughput only between comparable samples; Ctrl+C exits cleanly |
| `--errors` | Only sources that need attention, problems and recent errors. Never says "No problems found" when part of the status could not be read |
| `--verbose` / `-v` | Full ids and paths, builds, run ids, permits, home lock, last run and diagnostics (request count, cache age, consistency) |
| `--json` | The canonical report (`schema_version` 1) in the CLI envelope; not combinable with `--watch` |

Exit code: `0` when a report was produced (its health is in the report), `4` when the authoritative backend cannot be inspected (an unreachable server is never shown as an empty or stale report).

**Where the numbers come from.** Local mode reads only the home's SQLite catalog and project stores, plus this home's progress file and locks. Server mode reads only the configured OpenSearch/Elasticsearch prefix: the catalog, the active builds, published counts, file errors and the `{prefix}-runtime` heartbeats of every indexing host. Server mode never opens local SQLite for status.

**Meaning of the counters**

- `sources[].published`: the source's **published** (active) build only: files by status (`indexed`, `failed`, `retrying`), code entities, documents, chunks, relationships, links, the highest attempt count and the next retry time. A pending build is never counted. `null` when nothing is published or the section could not be read.
- `sources[].relationship_state`: the source's relationship graph, independent of `index_state`: `state` (`disabled`, `pending`, `building`, `ready`, `stale`, `failed`; a graph of an older base reports `stale`), the published `generation`, the `base_build_id` it was derived from, `last_success_at`, `last_error` and `stale_reason`. A `failed`/`stale` graph is a `relationships_not_current` warning; the index itself remains searchable. Relationship and link counts in `published` are those of the visible graph only.
- `sources[].live` and `indexer.workers`: passes **in progress**: run id, host, stage (`starting`, `scanning`, `processing`, `finalizing`, `publishing`), `scanned`, `planned` (files to process, known once the scan finished), `processed`/`indexed`/`failed`/`retry`, `percentage` (`null` without a planned total) and the heartbeat age. Several sources show several passes; nothing overwrites another pass.
- `summary.files.pending_in_current_runs`: planned minus processed over live passes; `null` when a live pass does not know its planned total yet.
- `last_scan_at`: a filesystem scan finished. It does not mean the source was indexed; a source is `completed` once a build is published and no pass is running.
- `recent_errors`: newest first by the time the error happened (`occurred_at`; server: the file's `last_error_at`), ties by source id and path, selected across all sources before truncating (25 by default, at most 200).
- Values that cannot be observed (pre-scan totals, remote PIDs, server disk usage, in-memory queues, ETAs) are `null` / `N/A`, never `0`. A section that failed to load is listed in `diagnostics.missing_sections` and the report is `partial`.

**States**

- **Access** (`access`): `online`, `offline`, `disabled`, `unknown`: whether the root is reachable, independent of indexing.
- **Index state** (`index_state`), first match wins: `disabled` > `offline` > a live pass (`queued`, `scanning`, `indexing`, `finalizing`, `publishing`) > `stalled` (a pass stopped heartbeating, or its server lease expired) > `unknown` (counters unreadable) > `retrying` > `failed` (the build failed and nothing is published) > `completed` > `not_indexed`. A failed pending build whose previous build still serves stays `completed` with a warning.
- **Liveness of a pass**: `live` (local: its process exists and its heartbeat is fresh; server: its lease token is still the source's live lease and its heartbeat is fresh), `stalled` (heartbeat older than `indexing.status_stall_threshold_seconds`, default `120`), `expired` (process gone, or lease expired/superseded: not running), `finished`. Heartbeats come from an independent ticker every 5 s, so a long OCR, embedding or linking stage stays alive without counting files; raise the threshold only if a host is overloaded.
- **Health**: `failed` on any error problem (backend unreachable, cluster `red`, stalled pass, crashed or failed run, a build failure with nothing published, all sources offline); `unknown` when the report is partial; `degraded` on any warning (cluster `yellow`, failed or retrying files, an offline source, an expired pass, a failed build that still has a previous build); else `healthy`. Every problem has a stable `code`, `severity`, `scope`, optional `source_id`/`host`, a hint and its observation time.

**Server mode cost.** One full snapshot reads the catalog once (paged by 1000), then per 1000 sources one file aggregation, one record aggregation, one relationship-graph aggregation and one error query, plus run heartbeats, cluster health and one consistency re-check: 8 HTTP requests for 150 idle sources. `--watch` keeps one connection and re-reads only the catalog, heartbeats and cluster health (3 requests) while no build is published; published counts are re-read on publication or after 30 s (the age is shown).

**Server schema.** Status adds `{prefix}-runtime`, `files.last_error_at` and `source-state.published_at` (schema identity 3). An existing prefix created by an earlier build is refused, never converted: use a fresh `storage.server.index_prefix`, or delete the RagMonk indexes of the old prefix yourself (`DELETE /<prefix>-*` on the cluster) and run `ragmonk server init` and `ragmonk rebuild`. RagMonk never deletes indexes automatically.

## Index locking

- Each source has its own writer lock, `locks/index-<source_id>.lock`: one pass per source at a time (CLI, daemon/watch, Admin UI, rebuild), while different sources index in parallel. Readers/search are never blocked.
- Whole-home operations (backup, restore, vector maintenance) take `locks/index.lock` and then every source lock in id order, so they never interleave with a pass; locks are always taken in that one order.
- In server mode a source pass also holds the source's **server writer lease** (`storage.server.lease_seconds`, renewed while the pass runs). Each grant increments a fencing token: a superseded or expired holder (for example a stalled process on another host) can no longer publish, abort or delete newer state.
- Waiting for a lock is bounded by `indexing.lock_timeout_seconds` (default `30`, must be > 0 and <= 3600). On timeout the error names the likely owner (PID, operation, source), e.g. `Another RagMonk process holds index-src_example.lock (PID 44884, operation=index, source=src_example); timed out after 30s`. The daemon retries a contended source after a short backoff.
- Find the competing process with `ragmonk doctor` or the PID in the error. Owner metadata is informational only (PIDs can be reused).
- Do **not** delete lock files to recover: the OS lock is released automatically when its owner exits or crashes, and deleting the file can break exclusion.

## Parallel indexing and resource budgets

`ragmonk index`, `ragmonk rebuild`, the Admin UI and the daemon run up to `indexing.max_parallel_sources` sources at once. All of them draw from one process-wide set of bounded permits, so adding sources never multiplies worker pools beyond the host:

| Setting | Default | Bounds |
|---|---|---|
| `indexing.max_parallel_sources` | `0` = `min(4, max(1, cpus/2))` | source passes running at once (1..=32) |
| `indexing.cpu_workers` | `0` = available CPUs | CPU-bound file processing across all sources |
| `indexing.ocr_workers` | `1` | heavy document conversions (PDF, scans, images) at once |
| `indexing.embedding_workers` | `1` | embedding model batches at once |
| `indexing.io_concurrency` | `8` | server requests at once |
| `indexing.max_in_flight_mb` | `512` | estimated bytes of files queued or being processed |
| `indexing.fairness_max_wait_seconds` | `120` | daemon: longest a queued source waits behind small watcher-triggered passes |
| `indexing.max_targeted_paths` | `512` | daemon: touched paths kept per source before the pass becomes a full scan |

A small code edit keeps making progress during bulk OCR (OCR holds its own permit). A failing, offline or panicking source never blocks the others; permits and locks are returned on every error path. `ragmonk status` shows every active source pass and, for local runs, per-class permit counters (`indexer.resources`: capacity, in use, peak, waits).

The daemon runs one worker per `max_parallel_sources`. A source has at most one queued follow-up while its pass runs; small watcher-targeted passes go first, but a source that has waited `fairness_max_wait_seconds` is started before anything else, so no source starves.

## Admin UI

`ragmonk ui` → http://127.0.0.1:8765. Manage sources, index with live progress, browse document chunks, test search, explore the code graph, edit config, control the daemon, backups and logs. Binds to `127.0.0.1` only, with CSRF protection and host-header validation. See [ui.md](ui.md).

## MCP (AI agents)

```bash
ragmonk serve --mcp   # register this command as a stdio MCP server in your client
```

Tools: `ragmonk_explore`, `ragmonk_search`, `ragmonk_documents`, `ragmonk_symbol`, `ragmonk_callers`, `ragmonk_callees`, `ragmonk_impact`, `ragmonk_status`, `ragmonk_ask`.

## Optional AI

```bash
ragmonk config set search.semantic true                  # local semantic search
ragmonk config set ai.provider ollama
ragmonk config set ai.model llama3.2
ragmonk ask "how are settlement retries handled?"
```

Providers: Ollama, OpenAI-compatible, OpenAI and Anthropic (require `privacy.external_ai_allowed: true`), Codex and GitHub Copilot (beta, `ragmonk ai login <provider>`; see [providers/](providers/)).

## Server storage (OpenSearch / Elasticsearch)

```bash
ragmonk init --storage-mode server --storage-engine opensearch \
    --storage-url https://search.internal:9200
```

- Server support is built into every binary and the container image; there is nothing extra to install.
- `init` validates the real cluster first (reachable, right engine, permissions) and creates the RagMonk indexes. Tested with OpenSearch 2.15 and Elasticsearch 8.15 in CI.
- Credentials only via env vars: `RAGMONK_OPENSEARCH_{USERNAME,PASSWORD,API_KEY}` / `RAGMONK_ELASTICSEARCH_{USERNAME,PASSWORD,API_KEY}`. Never stored in `config.yaml`.
- **The cluster is authoritative.** The source catalog (registration, include/exclude patterns, enabled flag), build lifecycle, writer leases and all indexed knowledge (files, code entities, documents, chunks, relationships, links, vectors) live in `{prefix}-*` indexes. No local SQLite registry or knowledge store is read or written. Local files are limited to `config.yaml`, logs, locks, models and a **disposable** extraction cache under `cache/server-staging/` (deleting it only costs reconversion).
- An unreachable or uninitialized cluster is an error (exit code 4 / 3, typed `BackendUnavailableError` / `BackendSchemaMismatchError` in MCP); RagMonk never falls back to local data.
- Every pass publishes a new generation atomically (compare-and-swap). Files whose derived knowledge did not change are **copied forward server-side** (their records gain the new build id in place; nothing is reconverted or re-uploaded); only changed files are written. A failed or interrupted pass keeps serving the previous generation; the replaced generation stays readable for `storage.server.gc_grace_seconds` (default `60`) and is then garbage-collected.
- Source roots are paths on the host that indexes them.
- Dev clusters: `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.opensearch.yml up -d` (or `docker-compose.elasticsearch.yml`).

Capability matrix (server mode):

| Command / tool | Server mode |
|---|---|
| `source add/list/info/enable/disable/remove` | ✅ server catalog |
| `index`, `rebuild`, `daemon`, `watch`, Admin UI indexing | ✅ |
| `status`, `doctor`, Admin UI status | ✅ counts, retries and errors from the published builds; cluster health |
| `search` (lexical, semantic, hybrid), `explore`, `ask`, `docs` | ✅ |
| `symbol`, `callers`, `callees`, `references`, `impact` | ✅ |
| `link list/add/remove` | ✅ (manual links stored in the cluster) |
| MCP tools | ✅ same data as the CLI |
| `backup`, `restore` | ❌ exit 3 (`LocalStorageModeRequiredError`): use the cluster's snapshot API |
| `vectors rebuild/backfill` | ❌ exit 3: vectors are written by every build; use `ragmonk rebuild` |

## Operations

```bash
ragmonk backup [PATH]
ragmonk restore ARCHIVE
ragmonk rebuild [--source ID]
ragmonk doctor
ragmonk update check|status|install|rollback
ragmonk vectors rebuild
ragmonk uninstall [--keep-data]
ragmonk config get|set KEY [VALUE]
```

## Updates

`ragmonk update` follows GitHub's latest **full** release. To also receive
pre-releases, for example to test a release candidate, run:

```bash
ragmonk config set updates.channel prerelease
```

The default is `stable`. Any other value is treated as `stable`.
`updates.enabled`, `updates.check_interval_hours` and `updates.notify`
control the background check and the "newer version" notice.
